                <p>I was  in robotics club and really enjoyed the hands-on activities we had such as building air powered<br> cars which we had to compete to see who had the best design to travel the furthest. However<br> during my 4 years there, COVID-19 struck for more than half of it making me unable to attend many<br> competitions. This is why most of my achievents came during the last 2 years. The most notable for<br> me is Hack@AC as it was my first introduction into CTF and the world of cybersecurity.</p>

                <h2>Passion</h2>
                <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>Why cybersecurity?</p>
                <p>One of my job aspirations is to become a cybersecurity engineer to peform vulnerabilities assessments and help fix vulnerablilites in websites which will prevent malicious attackers from stealing people's information. This is very important as nowadays millions are connected to the internet daily. Personal data are online which can be compromised by cyberattack. By becoming a cybersecurity engineer or a penetration tester, I have to be one step ahead to uncover these vulnerablilites and patch them so other people's information are protected. In a way, after solving the challenges in the CTFs, I felt rewarded with a sense of achievement.</p>
                <h3>Engineering</h3>
                <p>Why Engineering?</p>
                <p>One of my job aspirations is to become a computer engineer to help make new programs to improve the quality of life on the internet. Learning engineering will allow me to learn more about AI and machine learning models. I want to learn this as in the future AI will be all around us and I want to be ahead of the curve and pioneer my way through this field. I am also interested in the hardware aspects of engineering such as building innovative system. I also take Electronics for my Olevel and find working with hardware is very intriguing.</p>
